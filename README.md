# WORKSHOP-STUFF


Trainer.py creates a Gaussian Mixture Model w/ MFCC's using an Audio file, for both male and female classes. 

TesterOfModel.py contains 60 pieces of test data. Model currently has a 93.3% success rate using this test data as an accuracy measure. 


FEMALE AUDIO DATA: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhc9vnixuz81tx4/Female1.wav?dl=0

MALE AUDIO DATA: https://www.dropbox.com/s/dpawvo4zspgupoc/Male1.wav?dl=0

All of the test audio file is given through links (contained on the TesterOfModel.py file) which are parsed through a web-scrapper, audio contents extracted, and saved to a .wav file on the desk, resaved for the next file, and so on.
